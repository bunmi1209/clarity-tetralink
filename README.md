# TetraLink Network

A decentralized network for connecting and managing microservices on-chain. TetraLink enables service discovery, registration, and secure communication between different microservices in a decentralized manner.

## Features
- Service registration and deregistration
- Service discovery and lookup
- Secure service-to-service communication
- Service health monitoring
- Decentralized service registry

## Usage
Services can register themselves on the network by calling the `register-service` function with their service details. Other services can discover and connect to registered services using the `get-service` function.

## Security
All service registrations are verified and can only be modified by the original registrant. Service communications are secured through the blockchain's native security features.
